<h2 id="org4bebad3">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4bebad3">
<p>
I have always wanted a personal website. I have attempted several times at creating one.
The first function a personal website should serve is showcase your achievements, e.g. your former experience and projects.
The second function I have always seeked from my website is technical blogging.
Moreover, I wanted my website to be hosted for free, without any limitations.
</p>

<p>
In regards to blogging, I wanted to do it in the simplest way. Not too simple though, as Einstein said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler &#x2014;Albert Einstein
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In my previous attempts at building a website I never reached that sweet spot: things were either too complex or too simple.
In this blog post I explain what brought me to this point.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd7f80c3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd7f80c3">Previous approaches</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd7f80c3">
<p>
A popular approach is to host a static website on Github Pages with Ruby+Jekyll.
Github recently made this very easy with the <a href="https://github.com/github/personal-website">personal website project</a>.
I tried twice that approach because of how easy and fast it is to set up.
</p>

<p>
The first time I set up a simple website was few years ago and I did it with a minimal Jekyll template to showcase my github projects and my skills.
I had a page where I could easily write blog posts in <code>.md</code> files, placing the posts in a certain folder structure with a certain filename.
Simple enough, right? Maybe too simple. I could not easily control the website template. I had to write my posts in <code>markdown</code> files.
I quickly lost interest in the website and never blogged once.
</p>

<p>
The second time around was at the beginning of 2020, shortly after discovering Emacs.
I saw a beautiful blog online and made it a day's quest to replicate it on my <code>gh-pages</code> branch.
What the author was using was an R library called <code>rmarkdown</code>, which under the hood uses <code>knitr</code> + <code>pandoc</code> to render <code>.Rmd</code> files.
The final touch I added was so I could write posts using my favourite markup language, i.e. Org Mode.
I could write <code>.org</code> files, export them to <code>.Rmd</code> files and finally render them with <code>rmarkdown</code>.
The website's style was stunning also! Very easy to steal some CSS from his website.
</p>

<p>
I could blog writing <code>.org</code> files and I had a beautiful website.. Still I never blogged once. Maybe it was not simple enough.
The setup must have been working very well for its original author, a Data Scientist writing a lot of <code>.Rmd</code> analyses. Not so much for me.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1777c68" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1777c68">This approach</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1777c68">
<p>
Lately I have been very fascinated by the Clojure programming language. I will write a post in the future about it.
In the websites I am lurking, the community often speaks about Clojurescript which can compile to Javascript code.
Some of the <code>cljs</code> frameworks for simple-page applications seem simple and elegant (like most things Clojure related).
</p>

<p>
Today I found a minimal, beautiful blog set up with <code>shadow-cljs</code>, which had very little code, all of which was understandable enough.
It looks like the author is a <code>js</code> and <code>cljs</code> developer, so it has been interesting to learn some best practices since I have absolutely zero knowledge of frontend development.
</p>

<p>
Well, I forked his repo and it was extremely quick to build the website locally and deploy it to netlify!
New concepts I need to understand more:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>yarn</code> &gt; <code>npm</code> for managing dependencies, building and releasing</li>
<li><code>tailwind</code> + <code>postcss</code> for easy customization of your website's style</li>
<li><code>yarn shadow-cljs watch app</code> to develop while hot-reloading the website a-la-figwheel</li>
<li>Connecting to the <code>clojurescript</code> REPL to interact with the browser</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is a very exciting environment to develop my website and customize it to my liking! No more deciphering templates and stealing off CSS, I will customize it how I want.
</p>

<p>
The second news, even more exciting, is that the author wrote a simple logic to parse <code>.md</code> and populate the website.
This means that to write my blog posts I can write with Org Mode and easily export to <code>.md</code>.
I will also adopt the approach used in <code>ox-hugo</code>, that is to have a single <code>.org</code> file and have posts live under a heading.
I can then export a single post with <code>,e C-s mm</code>, i.e. calling <code>org-export-dispatch</code>, narrowing the scope to the subtree and exporting to a markdown file.
</p>

<p>
I really like having the full control over the website. Deploying to netlify means that I am not limited to what Github Pages lets me do.
In the future I would like to explore different things, like embedding an interactive <code>D3</code> visualization or a <code>vega-lite</code> SVG.
I am happy to <b>need</b> to understand the details for these integrations instead of resorting to a magical plugin in an obscure template (like with <code>hugo</code>).

<div id="outline-container-orga8538e9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga8538e9">Why blogging?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga8538e9">
<p>
Technical blogging is a great opportunity to learn how to explain something you <span class="underline">think</span> you know something about and how to organise your thoughts.
Before writing this post I thought I had a clear idea of what to write but at the end of the post I can see that I digressed and I could have benefitted from organizing the structure of the post beforehand.
It's okay since it is my first post, but see? Already learning!
</p>

<p>
In the future I plan to write about the things I deem interesting that I am exploring.
I do this for self documentation and to maybe help a fellow user who might come across the same problem I was solving and maybe it will help him save some time.
I will adjust with time around a certain size and type of content. I expect the two main categories will be data science and software engineering tooling.
