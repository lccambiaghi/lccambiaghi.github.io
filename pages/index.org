Hi! I am Luca, a computer scientist currently working as Data
Scientist at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). My work consists of a mix
of management consulting, software engineering and data science. I
enjoy solving the most critical business problems of our clients,
co-creating with them the final solution.

I do most of my professional coding in Emacs, writing Python code. For
hobby projects, I like to [[url_for:posts,slug=react-native-cljs][mess around with Clojure]] and Emacs Lisp. I
am very curios, I love exploring new tools and [[url_for:posts,slug=think-stats][to study new methods]].

I love travelling, in my most recent trip I have spent 2 months
between Hawaii and New Zealand. In my free time you will find me
climbing, scuba diving or hiking. Feel free to check out [[url_for:pages,slug=posts][my latest posts]].
